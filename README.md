# CodePanion
Clone Pens to GitHub

This project is primarily for [CodePen](http://codepen.io) enthusiasts. However, any publicly available web url should work as well!

### What is this?
CodePanion is an online tool that allows you to commit web files to github. It allows the use of online editors, such as CodePen, to commit files to a repository on GitHub. Now you can code and commit anywhere!

### What can I commit?
You can commit any file or resource that has a web filepath. However, all URL's are subject to cross-origin resource sharing restrictions.

### What do I need?
To get started you will need:
+ A GitHub username
+ A GitHub repository
+ A Personal Access Token
+ A web file/url

### What method is used?
Repository commits are made using a javascript method, found [here](http://github.com/michael/github).
